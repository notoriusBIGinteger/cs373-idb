		  <p>   This site is designed to help people decide and find what they want to eat. When posed with the question “Hey what do you want to eat?”, why is it that most people respond with the name of a restaurant or a cuisine instead of the actual dish that they want to eat? Lets face it, you have a craving and nothing else will satisfy it. You may want a chicken quesadilla but you respond “lets eat mexican”. You may want some gourmet pizza but you say “lets eat italian”. Next you start looking up restaurants that serve this particular kind of cuisine and reading their reviews. But the problem is that nobody writes reviews for dishes, they write it for restaurants.</p>
 <p>Sure this is helpful in some cases if you want to know how long food takes on average or how friendly the wait staff is, but you aren’t going to eat the restaurant. You’re going to eat the dish. This is what we are setting out to change. A person should be able to look up “alfredo pasta” and get a listing of every restaurant in the area that has either this dish of something similar complete with reviews about the dish. This site will enable people to not only find the closest enchilada, but furthermore the best enchilada.
